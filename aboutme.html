    <h2 style="font-size: 25px; color: #005B61; font-family: 'Arsenal', sans-serif;">Brief Introduction</h2>
                <p> Hello and welcome to my website! I just graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an 
                    English major and member of the Commonwealth Honors College! I was awarded certificates in 
                    Creative Writing as well as Professional Writing and Technical Communication, and 
                    through my schooling I gained significant education experience in the technical writing field. 
                    As I look to break into the technical space, I've begun my professional journey by working
                    as Folia Materials' Technical Writer!</p>
               
           <h2 style="font-size: 25px; color: #005B61; font-family: 'Arsenal', sans-serif;">Why Technical Writing?</h2>
                <p> Throughout high school I took multiple web page design classes  which 
                I really enjoyed! Following these courses I found the HTML/CSS that I learned to be fun 
                to play around with and utilize for projects. This is why I initially joined the PWTC program, and I became motivated to stick with it after being exposed to
                all of the other skills it helps develop. Utilizing new (MadCap Flare, Visual Studio Code) and old (Word) programs to craft tech writing projects has already provided me with a wealth of experience
                by graduation.
                </p>
