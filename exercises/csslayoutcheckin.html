            <h2>What Prompted These Photos</h2>
        <p class="text">My pure and undeniable talent prompted these masterpieces. The lighting, the framing, all perfect.
            These truly capture my work as a photographer, and are the most prized snapshots I have from my collection.
            They highlight my great triumph over Big Bird in 1996, detailing our heated battle across the 20th century and its 
            infamous finish.

        <p class="left">Photography is my passion, and I live to share that passion with the world (you are welcome). Here is a 
        picture of my glorious dog Blaze, who is standing perfectly still out of respect. He understands the honor it is 
        to have his picture taken by me. </p>
